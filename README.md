# hcandersenDk_data_2024
Extract of data for the website hcandersen.dk. This repository will not be updated. I will add a link to the more stable zenodo repository in September 2024. For further information about the sources see https://hcandersen.dk/om/. This page (in Danish) also names  the partners behind the digitization (The Hans Christian Andersen Center and Museum Odense) and the sponsor (Kulturministeriet, The Ministry for Cultural Affairs).
The scholars involved in the edition and digitization of the individual works are named in the headers of the specific files.
