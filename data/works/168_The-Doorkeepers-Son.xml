          <div rend="The Doorkeeper’s Son">
               <head type="main" rend="The Doorkeeper’s Son">The Doorkeeper’s Son</head>                <p rend="noIndent" xml:id="p_00001">The <hi rend="italic">General’s</hi> family lived on the first floor, the <hi rend="italic">doorkeeper’s</hi> son in the basement; there was great distance between the two families, the whole of the ground floor as well as that of rank and precedence; but they lived under the same roof, with a view of the street and the courtyard; in the latter there was a plot of grass with a blossoming acacia tree, when it blossomed, and under it the smartly dressed child’s nurse sometimes sat with the even more smartly dressed child of the General, ‘little <hi rend="italic">Emilie’</hi>. In front of them danced the doorkeeper’s little boy with large brown eyes and dark hair, and the child smiled at him, stretched her small hands out to him, and if the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> saw this from his window, he nodded and said: ‘Charming!’ The <hi rend="italic">General’s wife</hi>, who was so young that she could almost have been her husband’s daughter from an early marriage, never looked out of the window facing the courtyard, but she had given the order that the young boy of the basement family should be allowed to play in front of the child, but not touch her. The nurse strictly obeyed her mistress’s orders.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00002">And the sun shone in on those who lived on the first floor, and on those who lived in the basement, the acacia tree came into bloom, the blooms withered and fell, and new ones came the following year; the tree blossomed and the <hi rend="italic">doorkeeper’s</hi> young boy blossomed, he looked like a fresh tulip.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00003">The <hi rend="italic">General’s</hi> little daughter grew fine and pale, like the pink petals on the acacia flower. Now she seldom came down under the tree; she got her fresh air in the General’s carriage. She used to ride out with Mama, and she always nodded to the doorkeeper’s boy <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi>, even blew him a kiss with her fingers, until her mother told her she was now too old to do such a thing.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00004">One morning he was to bring the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> the letters and newspapers that early that morning had been placed in the doorkeeper’s living room. As he went up the stairs, past the door with the cubbyhole for keeping sand, he heard something cheeping inside; he thought it was a chicken that was whimpering, but it was the <hi rend="italic">General’s</hi> little daughter in her lace and gauze.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00005">‘Don’t tell Papa and Mama! for then they’ll be so angry.’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00006">‘What is it, young miss?’ <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> asked.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00007">‘Everything’s on fire!’ she said. ‘It’s all ablaze!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00008"><hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> opened the door to the small nursery; the window curtains were almost completely burnt, the curtain rail was alight and in flames. <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> leapt up, pulled down, shouted for people to come; without him the whole house might have caught fire.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00009">The <hi rend="italic">General</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">General’s wife</hi> interrogated little <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi>.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00010">‘All I took was one match,’ she said, ‘and it caught light at once, and the curtains caught light at once. I spat on them to put them out, I spat as much as I could, but I didn’t have enough spit, and so I ran and hid, for Papa and Mama would be angry with me.’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00011">‘Spat!’ the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> said, ‘what sort of a word is that? When have you ever heard Papa and Mama say spat? You must have got that from downstairs!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00012">But little <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> was given fourpence. He didn’t go to the baker’s with it, he put it in his piggy bank, and soon there were so many pennies that he could buy himself a paint box and colour his own drawings, and he had a great many of those; they seemed to come out of the pencil and his fingers. He gave the first coloured pictures to little <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi> as a present.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00013">‘Charming!’ the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> said; the <hi rend="italic">General’s wife</hi> herself readily admitted that one could clearly see what the boy had tried to represent. ‘He has a talent for it!’ These were words that were taken down to the basement by the doorkeeper’s wife.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00014">The <hi rend="italic">General</hi> and his wife were from distinguished families; they had two coats of arms on their carriage; one for each of them; his wife also had her arms on every article of clothing, on the outside and the inside, on her nightgown and her night sachet; one of the coats of arms was precious, bought by her father for shining thalers, for he was not born with a coat of arms, nor was she, she had been born too early for that, seven years before the coat of arms; most people could remember that, but not the family. The <hi rend="italic">General’s</hi> coat of arms was old and impressive; it could be something of a liability to bear one let alone two coats of arms, and the <hi rend="italic">General’s wife</hi> felt this liability, when she rode off to a court ball, erect and in all her finery.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00015">The <hi rend="italic">General</hi> was old and grey, but was a fine horseman, he was well aware of this and used to ride out every day with a groom at a suitable distance behind him, and should he meet anyone, it was as if he came riding in on his high horse, and he wore his orders, so many that it was beyond comprehension, but that was no fault of his. As a very young man he had been in the army, taken part in the major autumn manoeuvres that the troops had to carry out in peacetime. From that period he had an anecdote, the only one he ever told: his non-commissioned officer cut off and took prisoner one of the princes, and the latter, with his small troop of captured soldiers, himself a prisoner, now had to ride into the town, behind the <hi rend="italic">General</hi>. It was an unforgettable event, which, throughout all the years that it was retold by the <hi rend="italic">General</hi>, and always with precisely the same memorable words he had spoken as he once more handed the sword back to the prince: ‘Only my non-commissioned officer could take your highness prisoner, I could never have done so!’ and the prince replied: ‘You are incomparable!’ The <hi rend="italic">General</hi> had never been in a real war; when such a war passed through the land, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> chose the path of diplomacy, passing through three courts abroad. He spoke the French language so that he almost forgot his own; he danced well, he rode well, orders accumulated on his coat to a degree that defied comprehension, sentries presented arms to him; one of the loveliest young girls was introduced to him, became his wife and they had a delightful little child that almost seemed to have fallen from heaven, it was so delightful, and the doorkeeper’s son danced for her out in the courtyard as soon as she could take notice of such things, and he presented her with all his drawn, coloured pictures, and she looked at them, took pleasure in them and tore them to pieces. She was so fine and so pretty.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00016">‘My rose petal!’ the <hi rend="italic">General’s wife</hi> said. ‘You are born for a prince!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00017">The prince was already standing outside the door; but they did not know this. People cannot see far beyond their own doorstep.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00018">‘The other day our boy even shared a sandwich with her!’ the <hi rend="italic">doorkeeper’s wife</hi> said; ‘there was neither cheese nor meat on it, but she found it as tasty as if it had been a joint of roast beef. There would have been the devil to pay if the General’s folk had seen that meal being shared, but they didn’t see it.’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00019"><hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> had shared his sandwich with little <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi>, he would gladly have shared his heart with her if that would have pleased her. He was a good boy, he was bright and intelligent, he now attended evening classes at the academy to learn how to draw properly. Little <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi> was also acquiring knowledge; she spoke French with her ‘Bonne’ and had a dancing instructor.</p>
               <graphic type="blank"/>
               <p rend="noIndent" xml:id="p_00020">‘<hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> is to be confirmed at Easter!’ the <hi rend="italic">doorkeeper’s wife</hi> said; he had reached that stage.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00021">‘It would be a sensible idea for him to become an apprentice!’ his father said. ‘A decent profession is what’s called for! and then we would also have him out of the house!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00022">‘But he’d come home to sleep at night!’ his mother said; ‘it isn’t easy to find a master who has a spare room! And we must also give him clothes! the small amount of food he eats is affordable! he’s happy with just a couple of boiled potatoes! his classes costs nothing. Just let him go the way <hi rend="italic">he</hi> wants to, you’ll see, he will do us proud, and that’s what the professor said too!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00023">His confirmation clothes were ready. His mother had sewn them herself, although they had been measured and cut by the repairing tailor, and he was good at cutting; if he had had a different start in life and been able to have a workshop with journeymen,<!--’--> the doorkeeper’s wife said, <!--‘-->that man could well have become a court tailor.<!--’--></p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00024">The clothes were ready and so was the confirmand. On the day of his confirmation, <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> received a large tombac watch from his godfather, the chandler’s old journeyman, the richest of his godparents. The watch was old and well-tried, it always gained time, but that is better than losing time. It was an expensive gift; and from the <hi rend="italic">General’s</hi> family he received a hymn book bound in moroccan leather, sent from the young miss to whom <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> had given pictures as presents. At the front of the book stood his name and her name and ‘favourably disposed patroness’; it has been written as dictated by the <hi rend="italic">General’s wife</hi>, and the General had read it through and said ‘Charming!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00025">‘It is really a great mark of attention from such a distinguished family,’ the <hi rend="italic">doorkeeper’s wife</hi> said; and <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> had to put on his confirmation suit and, with the hymn book, go up and present himself and express his thanks.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00026"><hi rend="italic">The General’s wife</hi> was wrapped up in lots of shawls and suffering from one of the bad headaches that she always had when she was bored. She looked very kindly at <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> and wished him well and never her headaches. The <hi rend="italic">General</hi> was in his dressing gown, was wearing a tasselled cap and red-shafted Russian boots; he walked three times back and forth in his own thoughts and memories, stopped up and said:</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00027">‘Young <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> is now a Christian! Let him now also be a worthy man and honour those in authority! That maxim you will one day, as an old man, be able to say was taught you by the General!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00028">This was a longer speech than the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> usually made; and he then returned once more to his introspection and stood there looking distinguished. But of all that <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> heard and saw upstairs, what he retained most clearly in his mind was Miss <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi>; how lovely she was, how gentle she was, how ethereal she was, how fine she was! were she to be drawn, it would have to be in a soap bubble. There was a certain scent about her clothes, about her curly, blond hair, as if she was a rose bush that had just come into bloom; and with her he had once shared an open sandwich; she had eaten it with a gluttonous appetite, and nodded to him at every other mouthful. Did she still remember this? Yes, surely she did: hadn’t she given him the beautiful hymn book ‘in remembrance’; and the first time after that when the new year’s moon was visible, he went outside with bread and a small coin and opened the book to see what hymn it landed at. It was a hymn of praise and thanksgiving; and he opened it again to see what little <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi> was to be vouchsafed; he took good care not to open up the book where the funeral hymns stood, and despite this he opened the book between death and the grave; it was quite unbelievable! although he was scared when the lovely young girl was soon lying ill in bed; and every afternoon the doctor’s carriage stood outside the door.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00029">‘They won’t be allowed to keep her for long!’ the <hi rend="italic">doorkeeper’s wife</hi> said, ‘the Good Lord knows for sure those he will have!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00030">But they were allowed to keep her; and <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> drew pictures and sent her; he drew the Czar’s palace, the old <hi rend="italic">Kremlin</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Moscow</hi> exactly as it stood there, with its towers and cupolas, they looked like huge, green and gilded cucumbers, in <hi rend="italic">Georg’s</hi> drawing at least. This pleased little <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi> so much, and so in the course of a week <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> sent a couple more pictures, all of them buildings, since she could imagine all sorts of things behind the door and the windows.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00031">He drew a Chinese house with tubular bells on all of the sixteen floors; he drew two Greek temples with slender marble columns and a staircase round the outside; he drew a church from Norway; one could see it was completely made of staves, hewn and strangely positioned, each storey looked as if it had cradle rockers; though loveliest of all was a sheet of paper on which he had drawn the palace which he called ‘Little <hi rend="italic">Emilie’s’</hi>. That was how she should live; <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> had completely designed it himself, compiling it out of everything he found most delightful in all the other buildings. It had carved beams like the Norwegian church, marble columns like the Greek temple, tubular bells on every floor, and right at the top it had green and gilded cupolas, as in the Czar’s <hi rend="italic">Kremlin</hi>. It was a real child’s palace! and under each window he had written what that hall or room was to be used for: ‘here <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi> sleeps, here <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi> dances’ and here she plays ‘Guess the Stranger’. It was lovely to look at, and it was looked at a great deal.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00032">‘Charming!’ the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> said.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00033">But the old <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>, for there was an old Count who was even more distinguished than the <hi rend="italic">General</hi>, and who himself had a castle and a manor house, said nothing; he heard that it had been conceived and drawn by the doorkeeper’s young son. Well, he was not all that young, he had been confirmed. The old <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> looked at the pictures and thought a great deal to himself about them.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00034">One day when the weather was dull and grey, wet, horrible, was the brightest and best day of all for young <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi>. The professor at the art academy summoned him.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00035">‘Listen, my friend,’ he said, ‘let us have a little chat, you and I! The Lord God has been very good towards you as regards talent, and he has also been good to you when it comes to good people. The old Count on the corner has spoken to me about you; I have also seen your pictures, we will disregard them, there is a great deal that needs correcting! You can now come to my drawing school twice a week, and that will enable you to improve your drawing. I believe there is more of a master builder in you than an artist; you can give yourself time to think about that yourself! but go to the Count’s house on the corner straight away, and thank the Lord God for that man’s existence!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00036">It was a large town residence on the corner; around the windows both elephants and camels had been carved, all from ancient times; but the old Count was most fond of the new age and the good things that it brought with it, no matter whether it came from the first floor, the basement or the attic.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00037">‘My belief is,’ the <hi rend="italic">doorkeeper’s wife</hi> said, ‘that the more distinguished people really are, the less show of things they make. How delightful and straightforward the old <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> is! And he speaks precisely as you and I do; that the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> and his wife are unable to do! How dazed with delight <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> was yesterday about his good fortune with the Count; and today it is my turn, after having spoken with the influential man. Wasn’t it a good thing that we didn’t make <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> a craftsman’s apprentice! The boy’s got talent.’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00038">‘But talent also needs some outside help!’ his father said.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00039">‘It’s got that now,’ his mother said; ‘the Count has spelt things out quite clearly and distinctly!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00040">‘But it originally came from the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> and his wife!’ his father said. ‘We must also thank them.’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00041">‘We could certainly do that!’ his mother said, ‘but I don’t think there’s all that much to thank for; I want to thank the Good Lord, and also thank him for letting little <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi> start to recover!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00042">Things were getting better for her, and they were getting better for <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi>; in the course of a year he gained the small silver medal and later the larger one.</p>
               <graphic type="blank"/>
               <p rend="noIndent" xml:id="p_00043">‘It would have been better if he had been a craftsman’s apprentice!’ the <hi rend="italic">doorkeeper’s wife </hi>said and wept; ‘then we could have kept him here. What does he want to go to <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi> for? I’ll never get to see him again, even if he comes home again, but he won’t do that, the sweet child!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00044">‘But it will mean his good fortune and his glory!’ his father said.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00045">‘Well, many thanks, my friend!’ his mother said, ‘you’re saying what you don’t really mean; you’re just as sad about it as I am.’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00046">And that was true enough, both the sadness and the departure. It was a great stroke of luck for the young man, everybody said.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00047">And he took his farewell, also from the <hi rend="italic">General</hi>, though his wife did not show up, she had one of her bad headaches. At this leave-taking the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> told his one and only anecdote, what he had said to the prince, and what the prince had said to him: ‘You are incomparable!’ and then he gave <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> his hand, a limp hand.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00048"><hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi> also gave <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> her hand, and looked quite sad, but <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> was sadder even so.</p>
               <graphic type="blank"/>
               <p rend="noIndent" xml:id="p_00049">Time passes when one is busy doing something, it also passes when one is not doing anything. The time is equally long, but not equally useful. For <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> it was useful and not at all long, except when he thought of them back home. How were things upstairs and downstairs? Well something was written about it; and one can put so much into a letter, bright sunshine and the dark, heavy days. <hi rend="italic">The latter</hi> lay in the letter, which told him that his father was dead, that only his mother was left; <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi> had been like an angel of consolation, she had come down to her, yes, his mother wrote that, and added about herself that she had been allowed to retain the post of doorkeeper.</p>
               <graphic type="blank"/>
               <p rend="noIndent" xml:id="p_00050"><hi rend="italic">The General’s wife</hi> kept a diary; in it every party, every ball she had attended was listed, as well as all visits paid her by strangers. The diary was illustrated by the visiting cards of diplomats and all those of extremely noble birth, she was proud of her diary; it grew over long hours, year after year, during many bad headaches, but also during many bright nights – court balls, in other words. <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi> had been to a court ball for the first time; her mother was in pink with black lace: Spanish; her daughter in white, so bright, so fine; green silk ribbons fluttered like reeds among her curly blond locks, which wore a garland of white water lilies; her eyes were so blue and clear, her mouth so fine and red, she resembled a little mermaid, the most delightful imaginable. Three princes danced with her, first one, then the other of course; the <hi rend="italic">General’s wife</hi> didn’t have a headache for a whole week.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00051">But the first ball was not the last one, that <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi> would not put up with; so it was a good thing that summer came, with rest and fresh air out of doors. The family had been invited to the old Count’s castle.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00052">It was a castle with a garden, well worth seeing. Part of it was just as in the old days, with stiff, green hedges, as if one were walking between green folding screens that had peepholes in them. Box trees and yew trees stood trimmed into stars and pyramids, water gushed from large grottoes studded with mussel shells; around the grounds stood stone figures made of the heaviest stone, this one could see from both their attire and their faces; every flower bed had its own shape, as fish, coat or arms or monogram, that was the French part of the garden; from it one entered, as it were, an untamed, fresh wood where the trees were allowed to grow as they wished, and they were therefore so tall and so magnificent; the grass was green and could be walked on, it was also rolled, mown, cared for and tended; this was the English part of the garden.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00053">‘An old age and a new one!’ the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> said; ‘here they mesh so well together! in two year’s time the castle itself will gain its proper appearance, it will be a total transformation into something beautiful and better; I’ll show you the drawings, and I’ll show you the builder, he is coming to dinner today!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00054">‘Charming!’ the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> said.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00055">‘It’s just like Paradise!’ the <hi rend="italic">General’s wife</hi> said; ‘and there you have a knightly castle!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00056">‘That is my henhouse!’ the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> said; ‘Pigeons live in the tower, turkeys on the first floor, but on the ground floor old <hi rend="italic">Else</hi> reigns supreme. She has guest rooms on all sides: the broody hens separately, the hens with chickens separately, and the ducks have their own exit down to the water!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00057">‘Charming!’ the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> repeated.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00058">And all of them went to look at this splendid structure.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00059">Old <hi rend="italic">Else</hi> stood in the middle of the living room and beside her stood <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi>, the builder; he and little <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi> met after several years, met in the henhouse.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00060">Yes, here he stood, and he was handsome enough to look at: his face was open and firm, his hair a glossy black, and a smile played around his lips as if saying: I’ve got my tongue in my cheek, I can see right through you. Old <hi rend="italic">Else</hi> had taken off her clogs and stood there in her stockinged feet, in honour of the distinguished guests. And the hens clucked and the cock crowed, the ducks waddled off ‘quack! quack!’. But the fine, pale girl, his childhood friend, the <hi rend="italic">General’s</hi> daughter, stood with a rosy blush on her otherwise so pale cheeks, her eyes grew wide as if her mouth had expressed it, although her mouth itself said not a word, and the greeting he received was the finest greeting any young person could wish for from a young lady, unless they were related or had often danced together; she and the builder had never danced together.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00061">The <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> shook hands with him and presented him: ‘He is not a complete stranger, our young friend, Mr <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi>!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00062">The <hi rend="italic">General’s wife</hi> curtseyed, her daughter was about to give him her hand, but she did not do so.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00063">‘Our little Mr <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi>!’ the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> said. ‘Old house friends. Charming!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00064">‘You have become quite an Italian!’ the <hi rend="italic">General’s wife</hi> said, ‘and I take it you speak the language like a native?’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00065">The General’s wife sang the language, but did not speak it, the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> said.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00066">At table <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> sat to the right of <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> led her to the table, the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> the <hi rend="italic">General’s wife</hi>.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00067">Mr <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> talked and related and did so well, he was the life and soul of the dinner party, despite the fact that the old <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> could also be so. <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi> sat there silent, all ears, with gleaming eyes.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00068">But she said nothing.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00069">She and <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> stood on the veranda among the flowers, the rose bush concealed them. <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> was once more the one who spoke, spoke first.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00070">‘Thank you for your kindness towards my old mother!’ he said; ‘I know that the night my father died, you came down to her and stayed with her until his eyes closed, thank you!’ he grasped <hi rend="italic">Emilie’s</hi> hand and kissed it, that was in order on such an occasion; she went bright red, but returned the pressure of his hand and looked at him with her blue, wonderful eyes.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00071">‘Your mother was a dear soul! How fond of you she was! And all your letters she allowed me to read, I almost feel that I know you! how friendly you were towards me when I was small, you gave me pictures -!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00072">‘Which you tore to pieces!’ <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> said.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00073">‘No! I still have my palace, the drawing.’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00074">‘Now I am to build a real one!’ <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> said, and his words made him feel quite warm.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00075">The <hi rend="italic">General</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">General’s wife </hi>were talking in their own rooms about the doorkeeper’s son, he knew how to conduct himself, expressed himself with the knowledge of a connoisseur. ‘He could easily be a private teacher!’ the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> said.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00076">‘A genius!’ the <hi rend="italic">General’s wife</hi> said, and that was all she said.</p>
               <graphic type="blank"/>
               <p rend="noIndent" xml:id="p_00077">Mr <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> came to the Count’s castle quite often during the lovely summer months. He was missed when he did not come.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00078">‘How much the Good Lord has given you compared to the rest of us poor humans!’ <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi> said to him. ‘Do you appreciate the fact?’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00079">It flattered <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> that the beautiful young girl looked up to him, he found her exceptionally clever.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00080">And the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> felt increasingly convinced that Mr <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> could not possibly be a basement child. ‘His mother was a very honest woman, at any rate!’ he said, ‘I think that ought to be her epitaph!’</p>
               <graphic type="blank"/>
               <p rend="noIndent" xml:id="p_00081">The summer passed, the winter came, the subject of conversation was once more Mr <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi>; he was highly regarded and accepted even in the highest circles, the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> had met him at a court ball.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00082">Now the house was to hold its own ball for little <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi>, could Mr <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> be invited?</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00083">‘Anyone the king invites, the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> can too!’ the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> said, and lifted his heels a whole inch from the floor.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00084">Mr <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> was invited, and he came; and princes and counts came, and each one danced better than the previous one; but <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi> only danced the first dance; while dancing she had sprained her ankle, not seriously, but painfully, and so she had to be careful, refrain from dancing, watch the others, and she sat and watched, and the master builder stood beside her.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00085">‘You’d probably give her all of St Peter’s Church!’ the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> said as he passed by, smiling with sheer goodwill.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00086">With the same goodwill he received <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> a few days later. The young man surely came to thank them for the ball, but for what else? Well, he came with something utterly surprising, utterly amazing: he came with insane words, the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> couldn’t believe his own ears; ‘an astounding declamation’, a request that was unthinkable: Mr <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> asked for little <hi rend="italic">Emilie’s</hi> hand in marriage.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00087">‘My good man!’ the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> said, his face turning bright red. ‘I completely fail to understand you! What is it you are saying? What is it you are asking? I do not know you, sir! Are you planning to become part of my household! am I to be here, or am I not to be here?’ and he backed into his bedroom, turned the key and left Mr <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> standing there on his own, he stood there a few minutes, then turned round. In the passage stood <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi>.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00088">‘What did my father answer?’ she asked and her voice quavered.</p>

               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00090">There were tears in <hi rend="italic">Emilie’s</hi> eyes; there was determination and courage in the young man’s eyes, and the sun shone in on the two of them and gave them its blessing.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00091">In his own room the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> sat as red as a boiled lobster; he was still boiling, it spilt over into words and exclamations: ‘Lunacy! Doorkeeper madness!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00092">In less than an hour the <hi rend="italic">General’s wife</hi> had the news from his own mouth, and she summoned <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi> and sat alone with her.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00093">‘You poor child! To insult you in such a way! insult us! You also have tears in your eyes, but it becomes you! You are so lovely when you cry! You look like me on my wedding day. Just you cry, little <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi>!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00094">‘Yes, that I must!’ <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi> said, ‘if neither you nor father will give your consent!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00095">‘Child!’ the <hi rend="italic">General’s wife</hi> exclaimed; ‘you are ill! you are delirious, and I feel one of my terrible headaches coming on! all the ill fortune that befalls our house! Do not let your mother die, <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi>, for then you will have no mother!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00096">And the <hi rend="italic">General’s wife’s </hi>eyes grew moist, she could not stand thinking about her own death.</p>
               <graphic type="blank"/>
               <p rend="noIndent" xml:id="p_00097">In the newspaper one could read among the appointments: Mr <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> made a professor, fifth class, number eight.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00098">‘It’s a pity that his parents are in the grave and unable to read it!’ the new doorkeeper couple said, who now lived in the basement beneath the <hi rend="italic">General’s</hi> family: they knew that the professor had been born and grown up within their four walls.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00099">‘Now he’ll be joining the ranks of the top taxpayers!’ the man said.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00100">‘Yes, that’s a lot for a poor child,’ his wife said.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00101">‘Eighteen thalers a year,’ the man said; ‘yes, that’s a lot of money!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00102">‘No, his rank I mean!’ his wife said. ‘Do you really think he’s worried about the money, he can earn that many times over! and he’ll probably get a rich wife as well. If we had children, husband, then our child ought also to be a master builder and a professor!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00103"><hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> was certainly talked about in the basement, as he was on the first floor; the old Count allowed himself to do so.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00104">It was the drawn pictures from his childhood that brought the subject up. But why were they mentioned? The talk was of <hi rend="italic">Russia</hi>, of <hi rend="italic">Moscow</hi>, and there was of course the <hi rend="italic">Kremlin</hi>, which young <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> had once drawn for Miss <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi>; he had drawn so many pictures, one in particular the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> recalled: ‘Little <hi rend="italic">Emilie’s</hi> Palace’, where she slept, where she danced and played ‘Guess the Strangers’; the professor was extremely capable, he would probably die as an old cabinet member, it was not impossible, and before that to have really built a palace for the now so young lady; why not?</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00105">‘He was in a strangely cheerful mood,’ the <hi rend="italic">General’s wife</hi> remarked, when the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> had left. The <hi rend="italic">General</hi> shook his head thoughtfully, rode off with his groom at a suitable distance and sat more proudly than ever on his high horse.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00106">It was little <hi rend="italic">Emilie’s</hi> birthday: flowers and books, letters and visiting cards were brought; the <hi rend="italic">General’s wife</hi> kissed her on the lips, the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> on the forehead; they were loving parents, and both she and they received distinguished visitors, two of the princes. The talk was of balls and theatre visits, of diplomatic missions, the government of countries and nations. The talk was of capability, the capability of one’s own country, and this brought the young professor into the conversation, Mr Master Builder.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00107">‘He builds for his own immortality!’ it was said, ‘he is certainly also building a way into one of the first families of the realm!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00108">‘One of the first families!’ the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> later repeated to his wife. ‘Who is one of our first families?’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00109">‘I know who was being referred to!’ the <hi rend="italic">General’s wife</hi> said, ‘but I will not say the name! not even think it! God reigns supreme! but it would surprise me!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00110">‘Let me be surprised too!’ the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> said, ‘I haven’t the foggiest idea!’ and he sank into thoughtful expectation.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00111">There is a power, an unnameable power in the fount of mercy from above, the court’s favour, God’s favour; and all that fount of mercy little <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> possessed. But we are forgetting the birthday.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00112"><hi rend="italic">Emilie’s</hi> room was full of fragrance from the flowers friends had sent her; on the table lay lovely gifts as greetings and mementos, but not a single thing from <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi>, that was impossible, but was also unnecessary, the whole house reminded her of him. Even from the cubbyhole for sand under the stairs the flower of memory peeped out; there <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi> had cheeped when the curtains caught fire and <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> came as the first shoot. A look out of the window, and the acacia tree reminded her of her childhood. Flowers and leaves had fallen from it, but the tree stood there coated in hoar frost as if it was some immense branch of coral; and the moon shone large and bright between its branches, unchanged in all its changeability, as when <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> share his sandwich with little <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi>.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00113">From the drawer she took out the drawings of the Czar’s palace, of her own palace; mementos from <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi>; they were looked at and pondered over, and many thoughts were aired; she recalled the day when she, unnoticed by her father and mother, went down to the doorkeeper’s wife who was lying on her deathbed; she sat with her, held her hand, heard her last words: ‘Blessing! – <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi>!’ The mother had thought of her son. – Now <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi> made her own interpretation of this. Oh yes, <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> was there as well on her birthday, there without a doubt!</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00114">It so happened the following day that there was once more a birthday in the house: the <hi rend="italic">General’s</hi> birthday; he was born the day after his daughter, earlier than her of course, many years earlier. Now there were presents once more, including a saddle, excellent in appearance, comfortable and costly – only one of the princes had one like it. Who was it from? The <hi rend="italic">General</hi> was in raptures. There was a small note with it; if ‘Thank you for yesterday!’ had stood on it, the rest of us could probably have guessed who it came from, but what was written on the note was: ‘From one the honourable General does not know.’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00115">‘Who in the world do I not know?!’ the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> said. ‘I know everybody!’ and he went through his large number of acquaintances in his mind; he knew every one of them. ‘It is from my wife!’ he said finally. ‘She is having her little joke with me! charming!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00116">But she was not having a little joke, that time was long gone.</p>
               <graphic type="blank"/>
               <p rend="noIndent" xml:id="p_00117">And now there was a festive occasion, yet another one, but not at the <hi rend="italic">General’s</hi> house, a costume ball one of the princes was holding; masks were also permitted.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00118">The <hi rend="italic">General</hi> turned up as <hi rend="italic">Rubens</hi>, in Spanish attire with a small ruff, dagger and erect posture, the <hi rend="italic">General’s wife</hi> was Madame <hi rend="italic">Rubens</hi>, in black velvet, with a high neck, terribly hot, with a millstone round her neck, a large ruff in other words, exactly like a Dutch painting the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> owned; and one where the hands in particular were much admired! they looked just like those of the <hi rend="italic">General’s wife</hi>.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00119"><hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi> was <hi rend="italic">Psyche</hi>, in gauze and lace. She was like floating swan down, she did not need any wings, she only wore them as an indication she was Psyche.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00120">There was glitter, splendour, light and flowers, abundance and good taste; there was so much to see that nobody noticed the beautiful hands of Madame <hi rend="italic">Rubens</hi>.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00121">A black Domino, with an acacia flower on his hood, danced with <hi rend="italic">Psyche</hi>.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00122">‘Who is that? the <hi rend="italic">General’s wife</hi> asked.’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00123">‘His royal highness!’ the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> said, ‘I’m quite sure of it, I knew him at once from his handshake.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00124">The <hi rend="italic">General’s wife</hi> had her doubts.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00125">General <hi rend="italic">Rubens</hi> had no doubts at all, approached the black Domino and wrote the royal letters in his hand, these were denied, but a clue was given:</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00126">‘The motto of the saddle. One the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> does not know.’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00127">‘But I do know you!’ the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> said. ‘<hi rend="italic">You</hi> have sent me the saddle!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00128">The Domino raised his hand, and disappeared among the others.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00129">‘Who was the black Domino, <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi>, you were dancing with?’ the <hi rend="italic">General’s wife</hi> asked.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00130">‘I didn’t ask his name!’ she answered.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00131">‘Because you knew it! It’s the professor! Your protégé is here, your excellency!’ she went on, turning to the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi>, who was standing close by. ‘Black Domino with acacia flower!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00132">‘Highly possible, my lady!’ he replied. ‘But one of the princes also happens to be wearing the same costume!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00133">‘I know the handshake!’ the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> said. ‘I have received the saddle from the prince! I am so certain I am right that I am prepared to invite him to our table!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00134">‘Do that! If it is the prince, he is sure to come –!’ the <hi rend="italic">Count</hi> said.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00135">‘And if it’s the other one, he won’t!’ the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> said and approached the black Domino, who at that moment was talking with the king. The <hi rend="italic">General</hi> submitted a particularly respectful invitation for them to get to know each other; the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> smiled, absolutely convinced as he was of whom he was inviting; he spoke loudly and clearly.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00136">The Domino lifted his mask: it was <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi>.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00137">‘Would the honourable <hi rend="italic">General</hi> care to repeat the invitation?’ he asked.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00138">The <hi rend="italic">General</hi> definitely became an inch taller, stood even more erect, took two steps backwards and one forwards, as if to a minuet, and there was seriousness and clear expression, so much could be read from the <hi rend="italic">General’s</hi> fine face.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00139">‘I never retract what I have said! The professor is invited!’ and he bowed with a look at the king, who had certainly heard every word.</p>
               <graphic type="blank"/>
               <p rend="noIndent" xml:id="p_00140">And so there was dinner at the <hi rend="italic">General’s</hi> house, and the only ones invited were the old Count and his protégé.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00141">‘Foot under the table,’ <hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> thought, ‘and the foundation stone’s laid!’ and the foundation stone was truly laid with great ceremony at the house of the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">General’s wife</hi>.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00142">The man had come and, as the General knew and was very well aware, he had spoken quite as a man of high society, had been most interesting; many times the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> had to utter his ‘Charming’. The <hi rend="italic">General’s wife</hi> spoke of her dinner, even spoke of it to one of the ladies of the court, and she, one of the most witty and intelligent, asked for an invitation the next time the professor came. So he had to be invited again, and he was invited and he came, and once again he was charming, could even play chess.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00143">‘He can’t be from the basement!’ the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> said, ‘he must definitely be a distinguished son! there are many such sons of distinction, and this is no fault at all of the young man himself!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00144">The professor, who came to the king’s house, was welcome to come to the <hi rend="italic">General’s</hi>, but to become a part of it was out of the question, although it was all over town.</p>
               <graphic type="blank"/>
               <p rend="noIndent" xml:id="p_00145">He did become part of it. The dew of mercy fell from above!</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00146">So it came as no surprise at all that when the professor was made a titular councillor of state, <hi rend="italic">Emilie</hi> became his wife.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00147">‘Life is either tragedy or comedy,’ the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> said, ‘in tragedy people die, in comedy they get each other.’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00148">They got each other. And got three healthy boys, although not all at once.</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00149">The sweet children rode through the rooms and halls on their hobbyhorses when they visited grandfather and grandmother. And the <hi rend="italic">General</hi> also rode on a hobbyhorse right behind them: ‘As a jockey for the small councillors of state!’</p>
               <p rend="firstIndent" xml:id="p_00150">The <hi rend="italic">General’s wife</hi> sat on the sofa and smiled, even though she had one of her bad headaches.</p>
               <graphic type="blank"/>
               <p rend="noIndent" xml:id="p_00151"><hi rend="italic">Georg</hi> advanced that far, and a lot further as well, otherwise it would not have been worth the trouble to tell the story of the <hi rend="italic">doorkeeper’s son</hi>.</p>
